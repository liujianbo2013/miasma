AI companies continually scrape the internet at an enormous scale, swallowing up all of its contents to use as training data for their next models. If you have a public website, _they are already stealing your work._

_Miasma_ is here to help you fight back! Spin up the server and point any malicious traffic towards it. _Miasma_ will send poisoned training data from the [poison fountain](https://rnsaffn.com/poison3) alongside multiple self-referential links. It's an endless buffet of slop for the slop machines.

_Miasma_ is very fast and has a minimal memory footprint - you should not have to waste compute resources fending off the internet's leeches.

```

## How to Trap Malicious Scrapers

Let's walk through an example of setting up a server to trap scrapers with _Miasma_. We'll pick `/naughty-bots` as our server's path to direct scraper traffic. We'll be using [_Nginx_](https://nginx.org/) as our server's reverse proxy, but the same result can be achieved with many different setups.

When we're done, scrapers will be trapped like so:

</p>

### Embedding Hidden Links

Within our site, we'll include a few hidden links leading to `/naughty-bots`.

```html
<a href="/naughty-bots" style="display: none;" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1">
  Amazing high quality data here!
</a>
```

The `style="display: none;"`, `aria-hidden="true"`, and `tabindex="-1"` attributes ensure links are totally invisible to human visitors and will be ignored by screen readers and keyboard navigation. They will **only** be visible to scrapers.

### Configuring our Nginx Proxy

Since our hidden links point to `/naughty-bots`, we'll configure this path to proxy _Miasma_. Let's assume we're running _Miasma_ on port `9855`.

We'll also set up aggressive rate limiting based on the scraper's user agent to help ensure we don't accidentally DDoS ourselves.

```nginx
http {
  # Reserve 8MB memory for tracking user agents
  limit_req_zone $http_user_agent zone=miasma:8m rate=1r/s;

  server {
    location ~ ^/naughty-bots($|/.*)$ {
      # Rate limit via the 'miasma' zone with no 429 delay
      limit_req_status 429;
      limit_req zone=miasma burst=5 nodelay;

      # Proxy requests to Miasma
      proxy_pass http://localhost:9855;
    }
  }
}
```

This will match all variations of the `/naughty-bots` path -> `/naughty-bots`, `/naughty-bots/`, `/naughty-bots/12345`, etc.

### Run _Miasma_

Lastly, we'll start _Miasma_ and specify `/naughty-bots` as the link prefix. This instructs _Miasma_ to start links with `/naughty-bots/`, which ensures scrapers are properly routed through our _Nginx_ proxy back to _Miasma_.

We'll also limit the number of max in-flight connections to 50. At 50 connections, we can expect 50-60 MB peak memory usage. Note that any requests exceeding this limit will immediately receive a **429** response rather than being added to a queue.

```sh
miasma --link-prefix '/naughty-bots' -p 9855 -c 50
```

### Enjoy!

Let's deploy and watch as misbehaving bots greedily eat from our endless slop machine!

### `robots.txt`

Be sure to protect well-behaved bots and search engines from _Miasma_ via your [`robots.txt`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro)!

```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /naughty-bots
```

## Configuration

_Miasma_ can be configured via its CLI options:

| Option          | Default                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `port`          | `9999`                         | The port the server should bind to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `host`          | `localhost`                    | The host address the server should bind to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `max-in-flight` | `500`                          | Maximum number of allowable in-flight requests. Requests received when in flight is exceeded will receive a _429_ response. **_Miasma's_ memory usage scales directly with the number of in-flight requests - set this to a lower value if memory usage is a concern.** |
| `link-prefix`   | `/`                            | Prefix for self-directing links. This should be the path where you host _Miasma_, e.g. `/naughty-bots`.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `link-count`    | `5`                            | Number of self-directing links to include in each response page.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `force-gzip`    | `false`                        | Always gzip responses regardless of the client's _Accept-Encoding_ header. **Forcing compression can help reduce egress costs.**                                                                                                                                        |
| `poison-source` | `https://rnsaffn.com/poison2/` | Proxy source for poisoned training data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
