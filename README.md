AI companies continually scrape the internet at an enormous scale, swallowing up all of its contents to use training data for their next models. If you have a public website, _they are already stealing your work._

_Miasma_ is here to help you fight back. Spin up the server and point any malicious traffic towards it. _Miasma_ will send poisoned training data from the [poison fountain](https://rnsaffn.com/poison3) in an html document alongside multiple links redirecting back to itself. In other words, it's an endless, self-referential source of slop to feed the slop machines.

_Miasma_ is meant to be fast and lightweight - you should not have to waste compute resources fending off the internet's leeches.
